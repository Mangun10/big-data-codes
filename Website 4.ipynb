      "Enter the text content of the webpage:  What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.  Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).   Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.  The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.  Where can I get some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.\n"

Reviewed in India on 8 March 2025 Style Name: 2024 - 1.5 Ton 3 StarVerified Purchase I recently purchased the Daikin 1.5 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. This AC is a game-changer for several reasons:  Efficient Cooling: The cooling performance is outstanding. It cools my room quickly and maintains a consistent temperature, even during the hottest days. Energy Saving: The inverter technology ensures that the AC runs efficiently, saving on electricity bills without compromising on performance. Quiet Operation: The AC operates quietly, making it perfect for a peaceful night's sleep. Durable Build: The copper condenser coil enhances durability and ensures long-lasting performance. User-Friendly Features: The remote control is easy to use, and features like the sleep mode and timer add to the convenience. Overall, I highly recommend the Daikin 1.5 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC for anyone looking for a reliable and efficient cooling solution. It's worth every penny! Helpful Report  Aditya Gupta🔥 4.0 out of 5 stars High quality product from Daikin Reviewed in India on 3 April 2024 Style Name: 2024 - 1.5 Ton 3 StarVerified Purchase The delivery was quick and the AC was delivered 3 days before the date which is impressive. I got sms about installation booking on the same day and AC was installed next day. Installation was conducted by two teenage boys who were quiet inexperienced and took almost 5 hours in the whole process, they did try to sell their ODU stand @ ₹850 but I had already arranged iron angle stand made by local iron works shop for about half the price and they (installation guys) installed the ODU on my own stand.  They drilled a hole in the wall for the copper pipes and did not fill it with anything to shut it so I'll have to close it myself with wall putty or something else.  The installation team did not overcharge me for anything as I arranged everything on my own for less than half of their price.  Overall the installation was OK and very cheap (825 only)  Now come to AC after installation.  The AC takes quite time to start working but after that time the AC cools very fast and manages the temperature of my large room (230sqft)  Pros- 1- Four way swing  2- Air throw is very powerful  3- Indoor unit makes very less noise  4- The matte finish looks great  Cons-  1- Non convertible AC  2- Outdoor unit is very noisy  3- No batteries with remote  4- No user manual  As of now I've used it for just 30 minutes, will update after few days where the temperature rises.

Reviewed in India on 6 April 2019 Verified Purchase If you are looking for a complete package, then look nowhere other than Daikin.  I purchased the 1.5 Ton 4 Star AC 10-days ago, and until now I am impressed with what it has to offer. To give you guys a better idea, let me go through the whole experience.  Installation: Installation went super smooth. The installation guys called me even before the AC arrived. I told them that it had not arrived yet. They insisted on letting them know once it does. So, once the AC arrived, I called them, and to my surprise, they said that they are coming right away.  The installation process started, and it was done in 3 hours max.  Also, for those people who are saying that they are charging money even when installation is free, you guys have no idea about how AC installation is done.  According to the offer when I purchased the AC, the installation charges are free. This means that the engineers won't take labor charges for installing the AC. But, that doesn't mean that you also don't have to pay for the extra materials that are required to install the AC!  Also, the extra charges can vary heavily depending on the amount of material needed including pipe, tape and so on. In my case, it cost me 2500 INR, and I am super happy with it.  Build Quality and Design The build quality of the AC is excellent. The internal unit looks sleek and modern. However, I do have a complaint here. The bottom part of the internal unit slightly bugles during installation. According to engineer, it cannot be fixed (or removed) due to the backplate that is fixed on the wall. The AC resets on the backplate. Anyway, it is not a big issue, and hard to notice for visitors..so I agreed to not do anything else.  Functionality and Remote The AC functions as advertised. It cools and cools very nicely. However, I was not expecting that the AC remote would be so awesome! It has almost every functionality that you would need. Few of my key features that can be controlled through remote include Coanda mode which works in conjunction with a fan. You just turn it on and put a fan on the slowest speed. Your room will be filled with a cold ambiance unlike direct cold air in case of swing fans. I also love the display at the remote. It shows all the possible icons and notification that makes handling AC a charm! I also loved Good Slepe mode, Econo mode, and horizontal and vertical swing!  Manual The manual is also nicely crafted. I used it to learn about the AC which the engineers fail to tell me. I told the installation guys to give me a demo, but they couldn't. I don't blame them as they just basic stuff. I would request everyone who buys the AC to read the manual at least once to understand the true functionality of the AC.  Overall Value The overall value of the AC is just excellent. It is affordable and enables you to enjoy with minimal electricity bills(I am skeptical here as I am yet to receive the first electric bill, but I think it will be fine)!  Summary 1. Excellent build quality. 2. Out of the world AC remote. 3. Great feature-set 4. No display on the AC unit(CON) 5. Excellent manual  Overall rating: 9.5/10  About the service, I am not sure as I am yet to take advantage of it. However, from my friend circle and peers, they are well known for their service(at least in the Kolkata region.)
